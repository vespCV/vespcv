# Project Structure

The `vespCV` hornet detector is organized for modularity, testability, and deployment on a Raspberry Pi 4.

Product Requirements Document: [prd.md](mdc:../doc/prd.md)

Current file structure: [project-structure-documentation.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/project-structure-documentation.mdc)

Tech-stack: [tech-stack.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/tech-stack.mdc)

### Hardware Environment
- Target device: **Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM)**
- **Camera Module 3** via OpenCV or PiCamera2
- Runs in **headless** mode or with Raspberry Pi Connect
- Designed for **edge-only operation** â€” no cloud dependencies

### System Behavior
- Auto-start on boot using `systemd` or cron
- Graceful shutdown support (hardware or software)
- Logs stored locally in `/data/logs/`
- Monitor key system health indicators (CPU temp, RAM usage, uptime)
