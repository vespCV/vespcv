# vespCV - Asian Hornet Detector

## Introduction
In recent years, the invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) has posed a significant threat to honeybee populations and, consequently, to our ecosystems and agriculture. The vespCV project aims to develop an innovative, automated detection system that empowers beekeepers, volunteers, and researchers to combat this growing challenge effectively.

### Problem Statement
The Asian hornet is not only a predator of honeybees but also disrupts the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Early detection is crucial for effective control, yet current methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This gap in monitoring creates a pressing need for a reliable, user-friendly solution.

### Solution Overview:
The vespCV project leverages cutting-edge computer vision technology to create a robust detection system that operates on a Raspberry Pi 4. Utilizing the YOLOv11s model, our system processes real-time camera input to identify and log the presence of Asian hornets, providing immediate alerts and actionable insights.
