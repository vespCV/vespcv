# vespCV - Asian Hornet Detection System

## Overview
The vespCV project aims to develop an automated detection system for the invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina). This system leverages computer vision technology to provide beekeepers and researchers with a reliable tool for monitoring and controlling hornet populations.

## Introduction
In recent years, the invasive Asian hornet (Vespa velutina) has posed a significant threat to honeybee populations and, consequently, to our ecosystems and agriculture. The `vespCV` project aims to develop an innovative, automated detection system that empowers beekeepers, volunteers, and researchers to combat this growing challenge effectively.

### Problem Statement
The Asian hornet is not only a predator of honeybees but also disrupts the delicate balance of our ecosystems. Early detection is crucial for effective control, yet current methods are often manual, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This gap in monitoring creates a pressing need for a reliable, user-friendly solution.

### Solution Overview
The `vespCV` project leverages cutting-edge computer vision technology to create a robust detection system that operates on a Raspberry Pi 4. Utilizing the YOLOv11s model, our system processes real-time camera input to identify and log the presence of Asian hornets, providing immediate alerts and actionable insights.

## Dependencies
The following external libraries are required for the `vespCV` project:

- `ultralytics==8.3.137`
- `opencv-python==4.11.0.86`
- `numpy==2.2.5`
- `pandas==2.2.3`
- `gpiozero==1.6.2`
- `torch==2.7.0`  # Ensure this is the correct version for your Raspberry Pi

## Installation Instructions
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm.
2. Create a directory for the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir vespcv
   cd vespcv
   ```
3. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vespCV/vespcv.git
   cd vespcv
   ```
4. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Create a start script:
   ```bash
   # Create a new file called start_vespcv
   nano start_vespcv
   ```
   
   Copy and paste these lines into the file:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   cd ~/vespcv
   source venv/bin/activate
   python main.py
   ```
   
   Save the file by pressing:
   - `Ctrl + X`
   - Press `Y` to confirm
   - Press `Enter` to save
   
   Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x start_vespcv
   ```
6. Email Configuration (Optional)

To receive email notifications when an Asian hornet is detected, follow these steps:

   - **Create a Gmail Account**: 
   - Create an account for your hornet detector. You can use an existing email or create a new one for safety and to avoid spam.

   - **Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: 
   - Activate 2FA for your Gmail account to enhance security.

   - **Generate an App Password**: 
   - Create an [app password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en#:~:text=in%20or%20out-,Sign%20in%20with%20app%20passwords,-Sign%20in%20with) for your account. This password will be used instead of your regular email password.

   - **Configure Email Credentials**: 
   - Add your email address and app password to your `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   export EMAIL_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
   export EMAIL_PASS="your_app_password"
   ```

   - **Apply Changes**: 
   - Run the following command to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that you store your email credentials securely. Using environment variables, as shown above, is a good practice.
- The email will be sent when a Vespa velutina (vvel) is detected.

## Usage Guide

### Starting the Application
1. Open a terminal window
2. Type `./start_vespcv` and press Enter
3. The application window will open automatically

### Understanding the Interface
The application window is divided into several sections:

1. **Top Bar**
   - **START** (Green button): Starts the hornet detection
   - **STOP** (Orange button): Pauses the detection
   - **MAIL** (Gray/Blue button): Toggles email alerts for hornet detections
   - **GPIO** (Gray button): Controls the LED indicator (mockup for hornet trap or electric harp)
   - **LED Indicator** (‚óè): Shows the current status of the detection system

2. **Main Screen**
   - **Left Panel**:
     - Shows the latest captured image with detection results
     - Detection chart displaying Asian hornet activity (red bars) and other insects (gray bars) over time
   - **Right Panel**:
     - Recent detections (click any image to save it to your desktop)
     - Detection log showing detections and system activity

### Using the System

1. **Starting Detection**
   - Detection starts automatically when the application launches
   - The captured image will appear on the left side
   - The system will automatically scan for hornets

2. **Email Alerts**
   - Click the **MAIL** button to enable email notifications
   - When enabled, you'll receive an email when the first Asian hornet is detected (requires internet connection and email configuration)
   - The button turns blue when email alerts are active

3. **Saving Detections**
   - When a hornet is detected, the image appears in the "Recent Detections" panel
   - Click any detection image to save it to your desktop (requires internet connection)
   - Images are automatically saved with date and time information in the `vespcv/data/images` folder

4. **Stopping the System**
   - Click the orange **STOP** button to pause detection
   - To close the application, click the X in the top-right corner

5. **Continuing Detection**
   - Click the green **START** button to resume detection after stopping

### Tips for Best Results
- Ensure the camera has a clear view of the area you want to monitor
- Keep the camera lens clean and free from obstructions
- Position the camera in a well-lit area for better detection

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check that the camera is properly connected
2. Ensure the system has a stable internet connection for email alerts
3. Verify that the LED indicator is working
4. Check the detection log for any error messages
